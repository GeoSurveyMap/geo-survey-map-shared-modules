    DRY_SOILS:
      "<b>Desertification</b> - The process in which relatively dry land becomes increasingly arid, typically losing its body of water as well as vegetation and wildlife either directly via climate change or indirectly via soil degradation resulting from poor management.\n<b>Assessment of Soil Dryness</b>\n<b>Explanation</b>: Soil dryness can result from various factors such as insufficient rainfall, high temperatures, or poor soil structure. Understanding the primary cause can help in addressing the issue effectively.\n<b>What do you think is the primary cause of soil dryness in your area?</b>\nA. Lack of rainfall (Periods of little or no rain)\nB. High temperatures (Hot weather causing evaporation)\nC. Poor soil structure (Soil that doesn't retain water well)\nD. Overuse of water resources (Excessive use of water for agriculture or other purposes)\nE. Deforestation (Removal of trees that help retain moisture)\nF. Climate change (Long-term changes in weather patterns)\nG. Overgrazing (Excessive grazing by livestock)\nH. Other (please specify)\n<b>Comments for Answers</b>:\n- <b>Lack of rainfall</b>: Consider if there have been prolonged dry periods.\n- <b>High temperatures</b>: Think about recent heatwaves or unusually hot weather.\n- <b>Poor soil structure</b>: Notice if the soil is sandy or has poor water retention.\n- <b>Overuse of water resources</b>: Reflect on local agricultural or industrial water usage.\n- <b>Deforestation</b>: Consider if there has been significant tree removal in the area.\n- <b>Climate change</b>: Think about long-term changes in weather patterns.\n- <b>Overgrazing</b>: Consider if livestock grazing is prevalent and intense.",
    WET_SOILS:
      '<b>Assessment of Soil Waterlogging</b>\n<b>Explanation</b>: Soil waterlogging occurs when excess water saturates the soil, often due to heavy rainfall, poor drainage, or high water tables. Identifying the cause can help in managing water levels.\n<b>What do you think is the primary cause of soil waterlogging in your area?</b>\nA. Heavy rainfall (Frequent or intense rain)\nB. Poor drainage systems (Inadequate drainage infrastructure)\nC. High water table (Groundwater level close to the surface)\nD. Over-irrigation (Excessive watering of crops or gardens)\nE.

    EROSION:
      '<b>Soil erosion</b> - Erosion is the removal of land or soil through one or more processes. The main causes of erosion include the actions of water (rills, inter-rill, gully, snowmelt and river and lake bank erosion), wind (desiccation and wind-blow), translocation (tillage, land levelling, harvesting of root crops, trampling and burrowing animals) and geological (internal subterranean erosion by groundwater, coastal erosion and landslides). Erosion can also be increased by poor land management such as overgrazing, deforestation or inappropriate use of mechanisation (e.g., ploughing down a hill slope).\n<b>Assessment of Soil Erosion</b>\n<b>Explanation</b>: Soil erosion is the removal of the topsoil layer by wind, water, or human activity. It can lead to loss of fertile land and other environmental issues.\n<b>How would you rate the intensity of soil erosion in your area?</b>\nA. Low (Minimal soil loss)\nB. Moderate (Noticeable soil loss)\nC. High (Severe soil loss)\nD. Very high (Extensive soil loss)\n<b>What forms of soil erosion are most common in your area?</b>\nA. Wind erosion (Soil blown away by wind)\nB. Water erosion (Soil washed away by rain or rivers)\nC. Human activity (e.g., construction, agriculture)\nD. Gully erosion (Formation of large channels or gullies)\nE. Sheet erosion (Thin layers of soil removed over a large area)\nF. Rill erosion (Small channels formed by running water)\nG.

    SEALED_SOILS:
      '<b>Soil sealing</b> - The process of covering of a soil by buildings, or types of artificial material which may be very slowly permeable to water (e.g., asphalt or concrete). Soil sealing can cause rapid overland flow after precipitation where water cannot soak away leading to potential flooding. A soil is unable to function effectively when sealed.\n<b>Assessment of Soil Sealing</b>\n<b>Explanation</b>: Soil surface sealing occurs when the soil surface becomes impermeable, often due to urbanization or compaction. This can prevent water infiltration and affect soil health.\n<b>How would you describe the state of soil surface sealing in your area?</b>\nA. Minimal sealing (Most soil surfaces are permeable)\nB. Moderate sealing (Some areas are impermeable)\nC. Extensive sealing (Large areas are impermeable)\nD. Very extensive sealing (Most areas are impermeable)\n<b>What do you think is the primary cause of soil surface sealing in your area?</b>\nA. Urbanization (Construction of buildings and roads)\nB. Agricultural practices (Use of heavy machinery)\nC. Industrial activities (Factories and other industrial sites)\nD. Soil compaction (Soil particles pressed together, reducing pore space)\nE. Paving and concreting (Covering soil with impermeable materials)\nF. Natural processes (e.g., crust formation)\nG. Other (please specify)\n<b>Comments for Answers</b>:\n- <b>Urbanization</b>: Consider the extent of buildings and roads.\n- <b>Agricultural practices</b>: Think about the use of heavy machinery in farming.\n- <b>Industrial activities</b>: Reflect on the presence of factories and industrial sites.\n- <b>Soil compaction</b>: Notice if the soil is hard and compacted.\n- <b>Paving and concreting</b>: Consider the amount of paved or concreted areas.\n- <b>Natural processes</b>: Think about natural crust formation on the soil surface.',
    DEGRADATION:
      '<b>Soil degradation</b> - Negative process often accelerated by human activities (improper soil use and cultivation practices, soil sealing) that leads to deterioration of soil properties and functions or destruction of soil as a whole, e.g., compaction, erosion, salinisation.\n<b>Soil contamination</b> - The presence of a chemical or substance in the soil in a concentration that may be harmful to human health or the environment. Contamination may have a direct toxic effect on the plants, animals or humans living in, on, or from that soil, or have an indirect toxic effect due to accumulation in the whole trophic chain.\n<b>Salinization</b> - Accumulation of soluble salts (more soluble than gypsum) in the upper soil layers (saline soil = soil containing enough soluble salts to negatively affect most crop plants, commonly 4000 μS m-1).\n<b>Assessment of Soil Degradation</b>\n<b>Explanation</b>: Soil degradation refers to the decline in soil quality due to factors like erosion, contamination, or loss of nutrients. It can affect agricultural productivity and ecosystem health.\n<b>How would you rate the overall status of soil degradation in your area?</b>\nA. Minimal degradation (Soil quality is generally good)\nB. Moderate degradation (Some decline in soil quality)\nC. Severe degradation (Significant decline in soil quality)\nD. Very severe degradation (Extensive decline in soil quality)\n<b>What do you think is the primary cause of soil degradation in your area?</b>\nA. Erosion (Loss of topsoil)\nB.
